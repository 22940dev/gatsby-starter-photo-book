  Gatsby Starter Photo Book
</h1>

Hi, I made this starter to share my wedding pictures. This is a fork of my other project [Gatsby Starter Infinite Scroll](https://github.com/baobabKoodaa/gatsby-starter-infinite-scroll), which is more of a general purpose infinite scroll starter. This one is specialized for sharing photosets. 

## Get started

Fork and `npm install`. Run in dev mode with `gatsby develop`. Just drop your photos in `content/images` and you're all set! (Ok you probably want to edit some text, favicon, etc. - but almost done!)

## Features

- Beautiful, responsive "postcard" view for desktop users, compact view for mobile users.
- Infinite scroll photos on home page, presented on a responsive CSS grid with minimal whitespace.
- While the user looks at a photo, the next photo is being prefetched so it can be delivered instantly.
- Friendly to users who have disabled JS. All important features have a non JS fallback.

## Known issues

- Automated photo cropping is used and it is what it is. You can manually crop some of the photos if you like.

## ðŸŽ“ Attribution

- My wife Marianne was integral in the design.
- Icons are from FontAwesome.
- I will create a demo site with photos from [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com).
